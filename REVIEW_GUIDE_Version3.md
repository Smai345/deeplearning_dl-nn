## üì¶ Relevant Modules in This Repository

Below are the core modules and scripts in `@dennybritz/nn-from-scratch` that directly relate to foundational neural network learning and experimentation:

| Module/Script      | Purpose/Contents                         | Concepts Covered                          |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `1_neural_network.py` | Basic neural network implementation    | Forward/backward pass, weight updates     |
| `2_neural_network_with_bias.py` | Adds bias to network          | Bias units, improved training             |
| `3_mnist_network.py` | Network for MNIST digit recognition     | Data normalization, multi-layer network   |
| `4_neural_network_class.py` | OOP version of neural network   | Code organization, modularity             |
| `utils.py`         | Utility functions (data load/prep, etc.) | Preprocessing, normalization              |

**Tip:** For image normalization examples and code, review the relevant functions in `utils.py` and normalization steps in `3_mnist_network.py`.
